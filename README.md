*No code here, just issues! To see the current list, click "Issues" above.*

This is the list of outstanding issues for Madrona Labs Sumu, currently in beta.
An issue is something about the software that needs to be fixed. Often this means a bug in the code, however it could also be missing or incorrect documentation, a request for changing a feature, or a need for some other task to be accomplished.
